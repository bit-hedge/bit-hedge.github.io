					<a class="title"> Fireworks - Crypto Set For $9.5Bn New Year's Eve OpEx </a> 
					<p class="subtitle"> December 16th, 2021 4:36pm </p>
					<hr>
					<p class="text">
						Unfortunately for any crypto options market maker hoping to ring in the new year with a night out, one of the downsides to a 24/7 market is about to become very apparent as they're stuck partying with
						a record $9.5bn options expiry on December 31st - topping the previous high of $5.6bn seen during the raging bull market in March, when
						cryptos were still roaring 30% higher every month on the back of a supply shock and institutional adoption narrative gone into overdrive. 
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Nowhere will the celebration be more apparent than in new Wall Street darling Ethereum, where the coming expiry's notional is triple that of any previous month:

					<p class="text">
						And since Eth has plans not only to become deflationary but also to slash energy consumption by <i>100x</i>, some have also felt it's worth looking forward to the quarterly options in March where <b>for the first time ever open interest
						on an Eth expiry has outstripped that of Bitcoin</b> thanks almost exclusively to a *massive* buyer(s) of the 15,000 call. One has to wonder if it truly is just a single entity who has spent millions on these options,
						racking up the open interest to a number higher than many of the surrounding strikes combined. <i>Is that you, Novogratz?</i>
					</p>
					<img src="img/eth-march.png"/>
					<p class="text">
						UBS points to the strike as a potential accelerant should Eth break out to all time highs again and indeed the position looks able to generate up to a massive $1bn in delta buying should it expire in the money - although
						this author happens to think that may be just a bit too optimistic and by going out just one year later, such a buyer could catch the inevitable bull market continuation when the Fed reverses course on the <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1469808658473263106?s=20" target="_blank">shortest hiking cycle
						in history</a>. 
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						But anyways, while perhaps less 'standout' from previous numbers... Bitcoin still takes the top spot for this month with what will likely be its first $6bn roll-off, which is actually <b><i>half of all open interest!</i></b>	
					</p>

					<p class="text" style="margin-bottom: 8%">
						For now, it seems underlying crypto markets are in general far more removed from the options process than equities (which have become largely a derivative of options positioning and real rates). But the unprecedented size
						of this month's unwinds combined with holiday-level liquidity means traders may be in for a fast-paced start to 2022...
